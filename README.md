The following steps are followed for ICP-8:

In Jupiter notepad written the code for the following and mentioned the comments for the code and uploaded the "NNDL-ICP-8.ipynb" to repo:

 - First installed the packages Keras and Tensorflow.
 - Programming elements: 1. Basics of Autoencoders 2. Role of Autoencoders in unsupervised learning 3. Types of Autoencoders  4. Use case: Simple autoencoder-Reconstructing the existing image, which will contain most important features of the image  5. Use case: Stacked autoencoder 
 - In the programming:
 - Add one more hidden layer to autoencoder 
 - Do the prediction on the test data and then visualize one of the reconstructed version of that test data. Also, visualize the same test data before reconstruction using Matplotlib
 - Repeat the question 2 on the denoisening autoencoder
 - plot loss and accuracy using the history object  

In the "Neural Networks & DL Assignment_8 Screenshots & Github link.pdf" file consists of screenshots of the resultant compiled code and Github link to the repository.

In the Video Link consists of Video regarding the technical explanation of the code.
